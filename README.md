# 👋 Hi, I’m Jeorge

## 👨‍🏫 About Me  
I’m a multilingual linguist transitioning into Data Science & NLP.  
With a background in education, communication, and text analysis, I bring human-centered thinking into machine learning and data work. I’m especially interested in **corpus curation, NLP, ethical AI, and accessibility through language technologies**.

I’m currently training in **Data Science & AI** at WBS Coding School (Germany) while building portfolio projects in Python, SQL, and Linguistic Data.
